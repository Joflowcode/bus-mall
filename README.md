### **Reflections/Comments**
***
Speaking my code in regular conversational English than translating what I want it to do and why is helping me in programming. Significant improvement in this week assignment with this approach. This is an entire new language, and just as with any language my brain needs to think about *what* I want to say in my native tongue, and *then* I can translate it to the new language. Same approach when I reviewing code. Until I am "fluent" I need to keep translating it in conversational English to understand what I am reading and coding.

When I was learning Japanese over a decade ago, I would repeat the English words and phrases and then the Japanese words and phrases. Over and over. The more I spoke it the less time my brain needed to translate it.
