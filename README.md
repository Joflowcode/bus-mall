### **Reflections/Comments**
***
Speaking my code in regular conversational English than translating what I want it to do and why is helping me in programming. Significant improvement in this week assignment with this approach. This is an entire new language, and just as with any language my brain needs to think about *what* I want to say in my native tongue, and *then* I can translate it to the new language. Same approach when I reviewing code. Until I am "fluent" I need to keep translating it in conversational English to understand what I am reading and coding.
